# Closed_Domain_Question_Answering_System

---Dataset : The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD 2.0)

---Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting are used for predicting sentence containing answers to questions.

---LSTM is used as the Deep Learning Algorithm to predict the start and end index for the answer span in a paragraph.
